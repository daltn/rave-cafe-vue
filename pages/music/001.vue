      "Many failures attest to the difficulties of this life-affirmative
      threshold. The first problem of the returning hero is to accept as real,
      after an experience of the soul-satisfying vision of fulfillment, the
      passing joys and sorrows, banalities and noisy obscenities of life. Why
      re-enter such a world? Why attempt to make plausible, or even interesting,
      to men and women consumed with passion, the experience of transcendental
      bliss? As dreams that were momentous by night may seem simply silly in the
      light of day, so the poet and the prophet can discover themselves playing
      the idiot before a jury of sober eyes. The easy thing is to commit the
      whole community to the devil and retire again into the heavenly rock
      dwelling, close the door, and make it fast. But if some spiritual
      obstetrician has drawn the shimenawa across the retreat, then the work of
      representing eternity in time, and perceiving in time eternity, cannot be
      avoided." <br />- Joseph Campbell

      We played a set at Dark Matter Immersive's Garden of Eden installation at
      the cell. The installation is based around Campbell's Hero's Journey. The
      exhibition itself and 2020 was coming to a close so we focused our energy
      on the moment the hero crosses into the return threshold and arrives back
      to integrate the wisdom gained on the journey. Recorded on 12.29.20 on 2x
      XDJ-700s and a Xone 23
